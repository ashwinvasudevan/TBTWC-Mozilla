### Idea Description
*Please answer all of the questions below.*

* Idea name: sudo shutdown

* What is the problem you are solving for:  Peter Sunde, founder of Pirate Bay, was arrested by Police in May 2014. Before he was arrested, he was able to open up an app on his phone and shutdown down all his computers. Since the computer was encrypted, the police were unable to obtain any information from his computers. **Sudo Shutdown** is an app which will be developed to send remote shutdown commands to all computers. Provided that the partition is encrypted, data cannot be obtained. 

* Who encounters that problem (who is your audience - describe them): Media persons, open source activists, Journalists, Whistle Blowers, people with highly confidential data.

* How will your tool solve this problem for these people:  Our app, on touch of a button will issue shutdown command to all the computers involved. Our app will also provide instructions on how to properly secure your computer using encryption. 

* What are you going to create (app, add-on, extension, etc.):  App

* What are the next steps for building this tool: Development of the app.
